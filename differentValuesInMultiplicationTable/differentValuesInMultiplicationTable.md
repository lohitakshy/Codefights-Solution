Define a multiplication table of size n by m as follows: such table consists of n rows and m columns. 
Cell on the intersection of the ith row and the jth column (i, j > 0) contains the value of i * j.

Given integers n and m, find the number of different values that are found in the table.

Example

For n = 3 and m = 2, the output should be
differentValuesInMultiplicationTable(n, m) = 5.
