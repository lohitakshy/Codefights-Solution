Caesar Box is a simple transposition cipher used in the Roman Empire, in which characters of the given message are broken 
into multiple lines that form a square when stacked up and then read the square column by column.

Given a message, encode it.

Example

For inputString = "a message", the output should be
caesarBoxCipherEncoding(inputString) = "aea sgmse".

The square will look as follows:

a m
ess
age
Thus, the encoded message will be aea sgmse.
