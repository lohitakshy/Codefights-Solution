Given two cells on the standard chess board, determine whether they have the same color or not.

Example

For cell1 = "A1" and cell2 = "C3", the output should be
chessBoardCellColor(cell1, cell2) = true.



For cell1 = "A1" and cell2 = "H3", the output should be
chessBoardCellColor(cell1, cell2) = false.
