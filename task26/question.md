Given two sorted arrays of integers, check if there is at least one element which occurs in both arrays.

Example

For arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 5] and arr2 = [1, 4, 5], the output should be
checkSameElementExistence(arr1, arr2) = true;
For arr1 = [1, 3, 5] and arr2 = [-2, 0, 2, 4, 6], the output should be
checkSameElementExistence(arr1, arr2) = false.
